# Compendium Files for Lion's Den

Reviving an old project to produce updated XML compendium files which can be imported into the Fight club 5 and Game Master Apps.

I intended to publish 'released' files through here on the main branch.

I will add content from _Xanathar's Guide to Everything_ and anything from _Volo's Guide to Monsters_ that isn't included and the spells from _Sword Coast Adventure's Guide_. I will remove and cease support for all Unearthed Arcana and playtest material.

I will probably add content from Critical Role including the Blood Hunter class and the background and feats published in the _Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting_.

Will eventually work on adding items and background from the various module books. I will mark _everything_ with sources.

We are not affiliated with Leo or Lion's Den or ceryliae in any way.
